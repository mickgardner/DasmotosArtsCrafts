# Codecademy Off-Platform Project: Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts

There are three branches of code in this project:

1. "ithinkimfinished" -> which is the point at which I thought I'd completed the project and required some sort of code review or feedback.
2. "afterlookingatanswer" -> which is when I a) requested a code review and b) looked at the answer and did a diff of the two css files and html files to see what I missed etc. I made three specific changes to the code base (each with their own distinct commit) that represent the changes I think I needed to make.
3. "main" which mirrors "ithinkimfinished", just so that anyone who wants to review the code doesn't accidentally review the fixed version.
